Introduction
============

plone.recipe.codeanalysis provides static code analysis for Buildout-based
Python projects, including `flake8`_, `JSHint`_, `CSS Lint`_, `zptlint`_, and
other code checks.

This buildout recipe creates a script to run the code analysis::

    bin/code-analysis

By default plone.recipe.codeanalysis also creates a git pre-commit hook, in
order to run the code analysis automatically before each commit.


Installation
============

Just add a code-analysis section to your buildout.cfg::

    [buildout]
    parts += code-analysis

    [code-analysis]
    recipe = plone.recipe.codeanalysis
    directory = ${buildout:directory}/src

The directory option is not required. Though, if you don't specify a directory
the code analysis will check every file in your buildout directory.

Supported options
=================

The recipe supports the following options:

**directory**
    Directory that is subject to the code analysis.

**pre-commit-hook**
    If set to True, a git pre-commit hook is installed that runs the code
    analysis before each commit.

**flake8**
    If set to True, run Flake8 code analysis. Default is ``True``.

**flake8-ignore**
    Skip errors or warnings. See `Flake8 documentation`_ for error codes.
    Default is none.

**flake8-exclude**
    Comma-separated filename and glob patterns default. Say you want to
    exclude bootstrap.py, setup.py and all collective.* and plone.* packages.
    Just set "flake8-exclude=bootstrap.py,docs,*.egg,setup.py,collective.*,
    plone.*" in your buildout configuration. Default is
    ``bootstrap.py,docs,*.egg``.

**flake8-max-complexity**
    McCabe complexity threshold. Default is ``10``.

**flake8-max-line-length**
    Set maximum allowed line length. Default is ``79``.

**jshint**
    If set to True, jshint code analysis is run. Default is ``False``. Note
    that plone.recipe.codeanalysis requires jshint >= 1.0.

**jshint-bin**
    JSHint executable. Default is ``jshint``. If you have JSHint installed on
    your system and in your path, there is nothing to do. To install JSHint in
    your buildout, use the following::

        [jshint]
        recipe = gp.recipe.node
        npms = jshint
        scripts = jshint

    set jshint-bin to '${buildout:directory}/bin/jshint'.

**jshint-exclude**
    Allows you to specify directories which you don't want to be linted.
    Default is none. If you want JSHint to skip some files you can list them
    in a file named ``.jshintignore``. See `JSHint documentation`_ for more
    details.

**csslint**
    If set to True, CSS Lint code analysis is run. Default is ``False``.

    CSS Lint options should be configured using a ``.csslintrc`` file. A
    typical ``.csslintrc`` file will look like this::

        --format=compact
        --quiet
        --ignore=adjoining-classes,floats,font-faces,font-sizes,ids,qualified-headings,unique-headings
        --exclude-list=foo/bar/static/third-party.css

    This typical configuration includes a list of CSS rules that will be
    ignored as they are `considered useless`_.

    See `CSS Lint documentation`_ for a detailed list and description of the
    rules.

**csslint-bin**
    Set the path to a custom version of CSS Lint, e.g.
    "/usr/local/bin/csslint".

    If you have CSS Lint installed in your system and path, there is usually nothing you have to do. To install CSS Lint with buildout, add the
    following section to your buildout and set csslint-bin to
    "{buildout:bin-directory}/csslint":

        [csslint]
        recipe = gp.recipe.node
        npms = csslint
        scripts = csslint

**zptlint**
    If set to True, zptlint code analysis is run. Default is ``False``.

    Note that the buildout itself already depends on zptlint, so no extra
    configuration is needed.

**zptlint-bin**
    Set the path to a custom version of zptlint. Default is ``bin/zptlint``.

**deprecated-methods**
    If set to True, warnings about deprecated methods will be printed. Default
    is False.

**utf8-header**
    If set to True, Python files without a utf-8 header (like
    ``# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-``) will cause a warning. Default is ``False``.

**clean-lines**
    If set to True, **any file** containing trailing spaces or tabs anywhere
    on the lines will cause a warning. Default is ``False``.

**prefer-single-quotes**
    If set to True, Python files will be scanned searching for strings quoted
    with double quote signs (``"``). Default is ``False``.

**pep3101**
    If set to True, Python files will be scanned in search of existing '%'
    string formatting operators. Default is ``False``. See `PEP 3101 (Advanced
    String Formatting)`_ for more information.

**imports**
    If set to True, checks that imports in Python files follow `plone.api
    conventions`_. Default is ``False``.

**debug-statements**
    If set to True, scan Python files looking for debug-like statements.
    Default is ``False``.

**return-status-codes**
    If set to True, the code-analysis script returns an error code that
    Continuous Integration servers (like Travis CI) can use to fail or pass a
    job, based on the code analyis output. Note that Jenkins usually does not
    need this option (this is better handled by the Jenkins Violations
    plugin).


Known Issues
============

JSHint "ERROR: Unknown option --verbose"::

    JSHint                [ OK ]
    ERROR: Unknown option --verbose

Upgrade JSHint to latest version (>= 1.0) to fix this issue, e.g.::

    $ sudo npm install -g jshint
