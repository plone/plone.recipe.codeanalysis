Change history
==============

2.3 (unreleased)
----------------

- Install isort script if flake8-isort is installed as well.
  [gforcada]

- Add two new recommended flake8 plugins:
  `flake8-commas <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/flake8-commas>`_ and
  `flake8_strict <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/flake8_strict>`_.
  [gforcada]

- Split the plone specific flake8 pluings out of the ``recommended`` extra.

  [gforcada]

2.2 (2016-02-20)
----------------

- Fix issue where commit hook did not work on NixOS
  (fixed to use ``/usr/bin/env bash`` instead ``/bin/bash``).
  [datakurre]

- Allow to pass a folder where to run code analysis against.
  [gforcada]

- Increase minimum requirement of flake8. Older versions could make
  checks with exceptions in plugins as passed.
  [do3cc]

2.1 (2015-09-21)
----------------

- Remove debug statements checker,
  `flake8-debugger <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/flake8-debugger>`_,
  `flake8-print <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/flake8-print>`_
  and jshint can do the same job.
  [gforcada]

  `flake8-pep3101 <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/flake8-pep3101>`_
  works exactly the same.
  [gforcada]

- Remove deprecated aliases checker,
  `flake8-deprecated <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/flake8-deprecated>`_
  does the same job.
  [gforcada]

  `flake8-plone-hasattr <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/flake8-plone-hasattr>`_
  does the same job.
  [gforcada]

  some of them where part of p.r.codeanalysis up until this release.
  [gforcada]

- Remove leftovers from utf-8 checker removal.
  [gforcada]

- Remove imports checker,
  `flake8-isort <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/flake8-isort>`_
  does the same job.
  [tisto] [gforcada]

- Fix typo on test that prevented ipdb imports from being found.
  [hvelarde]

  Fixes https://github.com/plone/plone.recipe.codeanalysis/issues/122
  [gforcada]


2.0 (2015-08-07)
----------------

- Improve split_lines from analyser which makes exclude statements with more
  than one directory to be ignored with ``zc.buildout 1.7.1``.
  Fixes https://github.com/plone/plone.recipe.codeanalysis/issues/129

  [gforcada]

- Compile all regexes on initialization to not have to compile them
  at every single use, it should make code analysis faster.
  [gforcada]

2.0b1 (2015-05-03)
------------------

- Allow usage of wildcards in exclude statements.
  [saily]

- Add ``check-manifest`` as new dependency and a basic check.

  changed this behaviour to return True and succeed the code-analysis.
  Fixes https://github.com/plone/plone.recipe.codeanalysis/issues/71
  [saily]

- Exclude paths directly in ``find`` unix command which speeds up again a lot.
  [saily]

  Fixes https://github.com/plone/plone.recipe.codeanalysis/issues/44
  [saily]


2.0a2 (2015-04-30)
------------------

- Replace manual comparisons of buildout options to ``False`` with a
  ``bool_option`` method.
  [saily]

- Removed some plugins and replaced them with ``flake8`` plugins. Please
  not the API change in buildout. Following options have been removed:

  - **utf8-headers** has been removed, replace it with ``flake8-coding`` if
    needed.
  - **utf8-headers-exclude**
  - **prefer-single-quotes** has been removed, replace it with
    ``flake8-quotes``.
  - **prefer-single-quotes-exclude**
  - **debug-statements** has some reduced functionality, because python
    debugger checks should be included using ``flake8-debugger`` extension which
    also checks for ``ipdb``.

  Fixes https://github.com/plone/plone.recipe.codeanalysis/issues/112
  [saily]

- Add missing tests for deprecated_aliases parser.
  [saily]

  # noqa statments and nested quotes.

  Fixes https://github.com/plone/plone.recipe.codeanalysis/issues/66
  [saily]

  ``Analyser`` abstract base class.
  Fixes https://github.com/plone/plone.recipe.codeanalysis/issues/62
  [saily]

  bootstrap-buildout.py instead of bootstrap.py.
  [timo]

1.0b7 (2014-05-04)
------------------

- Add Javascript Code Style Checker ``jscs`` support.

  Pyramid and other web Python-based development frameworks.
  Fixes https://github.com/plone/plone.recipe.codeanalysis/issues/53
  [hvelarde]
